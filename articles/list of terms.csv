To make shitty posts on an internet messageboard	"A move intentionally designed to provoke, annoy, disrespect, or mock opponents. It can be performed by pressing d-pad up. While taunts can sometimes be used to please the crowd and therefore provide a moral boost to the one taunting, some taunts are not well used and will have the opposite effect (see: SFAT)"	"A wavedash is a technique that can be performed by air dodging diagonally following a jump, causing a sliding motion. This sliding motion is better than dashing for some characters such as Luigi and Ice Climbers, because any ground action can be performed from it. For some characters with shorter wavedashes (like peach) don\'t derive this benefit from wavedashing. Wavedashing has many other uses in competitive play, such as quickly grabbing the ledge, interrupting dash dances in order to unexpectedly perform a ground move, repositioning the character for easier coverage of tech chasing, repositioning for confirmed kills off of a grab (most notably seen when Marth f-throw-wavedash-fsmash floaties at ~90%), and much more."
